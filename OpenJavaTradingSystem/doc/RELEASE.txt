0) make sure that you have everything you need, e.g. you updated the ChangeLog and so on ...

1) modify the build.xml file to contain the right properties:
  <property name="dist-version"      value="0010" />
  <property name="dist-version-name" value="0.10" />
  the dist-version is the part used in the cvs tag. it is a four digit number
  where the first two digits should be thougt of as being before the dot and
  the last two digits the part after the dot as seen above.
  the dist-version-name is used in the .tar.gz file for the release

2) tag the cvs repository with the tag name TAG_${dist-version}
  change into your locally checked-out OpenJavaTradingSystem directory
  cvs tag TAG_0010

2a) Optional: if you later find out that you need to create a branch for a release then use:
  change into your locally checked-out OpenJavaTradingSystem directory
  cvs rtag -r TAG_0010 -b BRANCH_0010 OpenJavaTradingSystem
  cvs rtag -r TAG_0010 BRANCH_0010_merge_head OpenJavaTradingSystem

  the first command creates a branch and the second command creates immediately a merge_head
  tag so that later you will always be able to find out which parts still need to be merged!!

3) create the source release:
  ant dist-src

4) create the binary release:
  ant dist-bin

5) read the documentation of the sourceforge file release system
  https://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=6445&group_id=1 

5a) how to upload the files to the sourceforge anonymous ftp server.
  use a real commandline ftp client!
  > ftp upload.sourceforge.net
  username: anonymous
  password: cs224@users.sourceforge.net

  > cd incoming
  > put OpenJavaTradingSystem-bin-0.10.tar.gz
  > put OpenJavaTradingSystem-src-0.10.tar.gz
